## Experimental Section:

Some more non-academic things that I'll be sharing here soon.

### Works-in-Progress 

#### Rock-Paper-Scissor (Simulation)

An environment is initialized containing a total of (n=50 in the case below) independent agents belonging to either of the three classes (Rock, Paper, and Scissor). Each agent follows an independent policy and tries to survive for the longest time. Changing their policies gives rise to some interesting patterns to observe, an example of which is shown below

Code on GitHub (Soon)

This simulation was inspired from a viral YouTube Shorts clip which showed a very similar simulation; This code tries to visualise how different individualistic or group-based policies of survival would perform (and look visually).
