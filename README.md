I am working as an RA with IISc Bangalore on a research project funded by CAIR, DRDO. My current project involves developing novel techniques in the multi-modal domain to detect Fake News. It also includes finetuning large vision-language models and studying/repurposing them for various downstream tasks.</td>

#### Rock-Paper-Scissor (Simulation)

An environment is initialized containing a total of (n=50 in the case below) independent agents belonging to either of the three classes (Rock, Paper, and Scissor). Each agent follows an independent policy and tries to survive for the longest time. Changing their policies gives rise to some interesting patterns to observe, an example of which is shown below
